## Usage Examples

### Basic Control
```applescript
-- Play/pause without worrying about which service
Execute Action "Music Manager - Play/Pause Toggle"

-- Next track on whichever service is active
Execute Action "Music Manager - Next Track"

-- Set volume to 50% on active service
Execute Action "Music Manager - Set Volume" with value "50"
```

### Service Switching
```applescript
-- Switch to Spotify and pause Apple Music
Execute Action "Music Manager - Switch to Spotify"

-- Switch to Apple Music and pause Spotify
Execute Action "Music Manager - Switch to Apple Music"
```

### Triggers Based on Active Service
```applescript
-- Trigger when Spotify starts playing
Trigger: Device State Changed
Device: Music Manager
State: "spotifyPlaying" becomes true
Action: Turn on Spotify-themed lighting

-- Trigger when Apple Music starts playing
Trigger: Device State Changed
Device: Music Manager
State: "appleMusicPlaying" becomes true
Action: Turn on Apple Music-themed lighting

-- Trigger when any music starts
Trigger: Device State Changed
Device: Music Manager
State: "isPlaying" becomes true
Action: Dim the lights
```

### Control Page Integration
The Music Manager device is perfect for control pages:
- Display: Use `status` state to show what's playing
- Service icons clearly show which service is active (üéµ = Spotify, üçé = Apple Music)
- Single Play/Pause button controls whichever service is active
- Volume slider controls active service volume

## How Auto-Exclusive Works

When **Auto-Exclusive Playback** is enabled:

1. **You start Spotify** while Apple Music or VLC is playing
   - Music Manager detects Spotify started
   - Automatically pauses Apple Music and VLC
   - Updates active service to Spotify

2. **You start Apple Music** while Spotify or VLC is playing
   - Music Manager detects Apple Music started
   - Automatically pauses Spotify and VLC
   - Updates active service to Apple Music

3. **You start VLC** while Spotify or Apple Music is playing
   - Music Manager detects VLC started
   - Automatically pauses Spotify and Apple Music
   - Updates active service to VLC

4. **All services are stopped**
   - Music Manager uses your preferred service setting
   - Commands route to preferred service
   - Or uses last active service if preference is "last"

## Advanced Usage

### Python Scripting
```python
# Get the Music Manager device
music = indigo.devices["Music Manager"]

# Check which service is active
if music.states['activeService'] == 'spotify':
    indigo.server.log("Spotify is active")
elif music.states['activeService'] == 'applemusic':
    indigo.server.log("Apple Music is active")

# Check if anything is playing
if music.states['isPlaying']:
    track = music.states['trackName']
    artist = music.states['artist']
    indigo.server.log(f"Now playing: {artist} - {track}")

# Switch services
indigo.device.execute("Music Manager", action="switchToSpotify")
```

### Context-Aware Automation
```python
# Play different services based on time of day
import datetime

hour = datetime.datetime.now().hour

if 6 <= hour < 9:
    # Morning: Use Apple Music for calm playlists
    indigo.device.execute("Music Manager", action="switchToAppleMusic")
    indigo.device.execute("Apple Music Player", action="playPlaylist", 
                         props={"playlistName": "Morning Calm"})
elif 17 <= hour < 22:
    # Evening: Use Spotify for Discover Weekly
    indigo.device.execute("Music Manager", action="switchToSpotify")
    indigo.device.execute("Spotify Player", action="playPlaylist",
                         props={"playlistUri": "spotify:playlist:37i9dQZEVXcQ9COmYvdRRZ"})
```

### Room-Based Music Control
```python
# Different rooms prefer different services
room = "Living Room"

if room == "Living Room":
    # Living room uses Apple Music
    indigo.device.execute("Music Manager", action="switchToAppleMusic")
elif room == "Office":
    # Office uses Spotify
    indigo.device.execute("Music Manager", action="switchToSpotify")

# Now play music - it'll use the right service
indigo.device.execute("Music Manager", action="play")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Switching Services
- Verify both Spotify and Apple Music plugins are running
- Check that device IDs are correctly configured
- Ensure "Auto-Exclusive Playback" is enabled
- Check Indigo log for errors

### Commands Not Working
- Verify the active service has music queued
- Check that the underlying plugin (Spotify/Apple Music) is responding
- Try executing commands directly on the Spotify/Apple Music device to test

### Active Service Shows "none"
- This is normal when nothing is playing
- Commands will route to your preferred service
- Play something to establish an active service

### Both Services Playing Simultaneously
- Check that "Auto-Exclusive Playback" is enabled
- There may be a brief moment during switching where both play
- If persistent, check for errors in the Indigo log

### Status Not Updating
- The plugin polls every 0.5 seconds
- Verify both underlying devices are updating
- Try "Update Now" action to force refresh
- Check that both Spotify and Apple Music apps are running

## Technical Details

### How It Works
- Monitors both Spotify and Apple Music devices in real-time
- Detects state changes (playing, paused, stopped)
- Enforces mutual exclusion when auto-exclusive is enabled
- Routes all commands to the appropriate active service
- Updates unified status from active service

### Performance
- Polls both services every 0.5 seconds
- Minimal overhead - just reads states from existing devices
- No direct AppleScript/API calls (uses existing plugins)
- Updates only trigger actions when necessary

### Dependencies
- At least two of: Spotify Control Plugin, Apple Music Control Plugin, VLC Control Plugin
- Corresponding devices must be configured for each plugin you're using

## Comparison: Direct Control vs Music Manager

| Feature | Direct Control | Music Manager |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Service-specific control | ‚úì | ‚úì (routes to active) |
| Unified control | ‚úó | ‚úì |
| Auto-exclusive playback | Manual triggers needed | ‚úì Built-in |
| Service switching | Manual | ‚úì One action |
| Simplified UI | ‚úó | ‚úì One device |
| Advanced features | ‚úì Full access | ‚úì Via direct devices |

**Recommendation**: Use Music Manager for everyday control and Control Pages, but keep direct access to Spotify/Apple Music devices for service-specific features (playlists, search, ratings, etc.)

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Both Plugins Enabled**: Music Manager depends on both plugins running
2. **Use Music Manager for Control Pages**: Provides cleaner, unified interface
3. **Use Direct Devices for Setup**: Create playlists, queue music, etc. on the actual service
4. **Let Auto-Exclusive Handle Switching**: Don't manually pause when switching services
5. **Set Your Preference**: Configure preferred service for when nothing is playing
